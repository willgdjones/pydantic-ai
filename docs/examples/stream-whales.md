Information about whales — an example of streamed structured response validation.

Demonstrates:

* [streaming structured output](../output.md#streaming-structured-output)

This script streams structured responses from GPT-4 about whales, validates the data
and displays it as a dynamic table using [`rich`](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) as the data is received.

## Running the Example

With [dependencies installed and environment variables set](./setup.md#usage), run:

```bash
python/uv-run -m pydantic_ai_examples.stream_whales
```

Should give an output like this:
